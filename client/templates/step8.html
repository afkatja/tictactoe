  <h1>Do we have a winner?</h1>
  <p class="flow-text">In this step, we will be detecting if we have a winner, on each click on a box.</p>
  <p>How can we determine if we have a winner? Let's try to determine the rules in plain English, this is what we call <code>pseudo code</code></p>
  <p>Here it goes: if we have three same values in one row / column / diagonal, we have a winner. This is what wikipedia says about it:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">
    The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Can you think (or draw) of the possible winning combinations? (The above wikipedia article has them all drawn out for you)</p>
  <p>Box 1, box 2 and box 3 form one row. Box 1, box 4 and box 7 form a column. Box 1, box 5 and box 9 form a diagonal. And so on for all the possible combinations (there are 3 for rows, 3 for columns and 2 for diagonals, for each symbol).</p>
  <p>This can be translated into code:</p>
  {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
  var hasWon = function() {
    var boxes = Boxes.find({}).fetch(); //make a plain Array of our Collection
    if (boxes[0].player == 'X' && boxes[1].player == 'X' && boxes[2].player == 'X') return true; //we have a winner
    if (boxes[3].player == 'X' && boxes[4].player == 'X' && boxes[5].player == 'X') return true; //we have a winner
    //etc...
    return false; //otherwise, there is no winner
  }
  {{/prism}}
  <p>We are making a function that we call <code>hasWon</code> that looks at the gameboard and returns if there is a winner.</p>
  <p>Whether we have a winner is called the <code>state</code>. Another example of a state in our game is whether a box is filled or empty.</p>
  <h2>Let's optimize</h2>
  <p>We ended up now copying and pasting 16 combinations. When we were trying to display 9 boxes in our grid, remeber we did not want to do this copying and pasting?</p>
  <p>We can begin with using the variable we made for the current player symbol. This should reduce our code to 8 lines.</p>
  {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
    var player = Session.get('player');
  {{/prism}}
  <p>And use it to compare it with the player values in the boxes.</p>
  {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
    boxes[0].player == player
  {{/prism}}

  <p>Your function should look like this</p>
  {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
    var hasWon = function() {
      var boxes = Boxes.find().fetch();
      var player = Session.get('player');
      if(boxes[0] && boxes[0].player) {
        if (boxes[0].player == player && boxes[1].player == player && boxes[2].player == player) return true;
        if (boxes[3].player == player && boxes[4].player == player && boxes[5].player == player) return true;
        //... 6 more rules
      }
      return false;
    };
{{/prism}}
<p>And you can check if someone has won in box click-event handler. Make sure that the function is called <i>after</i> you have updated the collection, but <i>before</i> you switch players.</p>
{{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
  Boxes.update(this._id, { $set: { player: sessionPlayer } });
  if(hasWon()) {
    console.log("Player", Session.get('player'),"has won");
  } else {
    console.log('Player', Session.get('player'),'has NOT won');
    setNextPlayer();
  }
{{/prism}}

{{>summary}}
<p>We added the game logic and we know when a player has won.</p>
